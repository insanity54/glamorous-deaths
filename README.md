# Glamorous Deaths

A Minetest mod to give your deaths some pizzazz with messages. A fork of
EvergreenTree's [death_messages](https://github.com/4Evergreen4/death_messages)
with fixes and improvements.

This mod announces a player's death server-wide. You might recall such behavior
from a certain popular mining game or an old-school shooter. The messages are
randomizedâ€¦ Unless you don't want that; One can configure the mod to only use
the finest message available for each particular death.
